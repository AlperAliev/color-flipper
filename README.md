Color Flipper

A simple color-changing application that allows users to switch the background color of the page using four buttons. The user can select predefined colors or generate a completely random color with a single click.

Features

Four buttons: Green, Red, Blue, and Random

Clicking a predefined color button changes the background to that exact color

Clicking the Random button generates a new color each time

The random color is generated by mixing random RGB values

Background updates instantly with every click

How It Works

The JavaScript functionality handles:

Listening for button clicks

Applying predefined background colors for the Green, Red, and Blue buttons

Randomly generating an RGB color for the Random button

Updating the page background with the selected or generated color

Each time the Random button is pressed, the script generates new RGB values, ensuring a different color on every click.
